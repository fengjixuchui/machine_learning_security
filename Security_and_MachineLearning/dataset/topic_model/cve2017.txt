When asking to get a file from a file URL libcurl provides a feature that outputs meta_data about the file using HTTP_like headers. The code doing this would send the wrong buffer to the user stdout or the application's provide callback which could lead to other private data from the heap to get inadvertently displayed. The wrong buffer was an uninitialized memory area allocated on the heap and if it turned out to not contain any zero byte it would continue and display the data following that buffer in memory

When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very long file name longer than about bytes the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length. This too large value is then used in the sendto call making curl attempt to send more data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto function will then read beyond the end of the heap based buffer. A malicious HTTP S server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl_using client to a crafted TFTP URL if the client hasn't restricted which protocols it allows redirects to and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with __proto_redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS
curl supports globbing of URLs in which a user can pass a numerical range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted or just wrongly written URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be

Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. Its SCM content REST API supports the pipeline creation and editing feature in Blue Ocean. The SCM content REST API did not check the current user's authentication or credentials. If the GitHub organization folder was created via Blue Ocean it retained a reference to its creator's GitHub credentials. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to create arbitrary commits in the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder with the GitHub credentials of the creator of the organization folder. Additionally users with read access to the GitHub organization folder could read arbitrary file contents from the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder if the branch contained a Jenkinsfile which could be created using the other part of this vulnerability and they could provide the organization folder name repository name branch name and file name
Script Security Plugin did not apply sandboxing restrictions to constructor invocations via positional arguments list super constructor invocations method references and type coercion expressions. This could be used to invoke arbitrary constructors and methods bypassing sandbox protection

Linux kernel heap out_of_bounds in AF_PACKET sockets. This new issue is analogous to previously disclosed In both cases a socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar lock the socket for the update. This issue may be exploitable we did not investigate further. As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled any process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW
Linux kernel Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non_UFO path switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data calls ip_ufo_append_data to append. However in between two send calls the append path can be switched from UFO to non_UFO one which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU copy = maxfraglen _ skb_>len becomes negative on the non_UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev_>len _ maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU causing copy = datalen _ transhdrlen _ fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits writes out_of_bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in e89e9cf539a2 [IPv4/IPv6] UFO Scatter_gather approach on Oct 2005

Linux distributions that have not patched their long_term kernels with committed on April 2015 This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 backported to Linux in May but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled and a normal top_down address allocation strategy load_elf_binary will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm_>mmap_base. Unfortunately load_elf_ binary does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm_>mmap_base the subsequent PT_LOAD segment s end up being mapped above mm_>mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the gap between the stack and the binary
libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in anonymous or not it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a response containing the path inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl_based clients to work with it _ the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit March 2005. In libcurl version the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote

IBM Rational Team Concert RTC and is vulnerable to Cross_site_scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. IBM X_Force ID 121151
An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through for Android through w for Web and through for Desktop. The product's protocol only tries to ensure confidentiality. In the whole protocol no integrity or authenticity checks are done. Therefore man_in_the_middle attackers can conduct replay attacks
An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through for Android through w for Web and through for Desktop. For authentication the user password is hashed directly with SHA_512 without a salt or another key_derivation mechanism to enable a secure secret for authentication. Moreover only the first bytes of the hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow_table attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash
An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat before for Android. No certificate pinning is implemented therefore the attacker could issue a certificate for the backend and the application would not notice it
An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through for Android through w for Web and through for Desktop. To encrypt messages AES in CBC mode is used with a pseudo_random secret. This secret and the IV are generated with math.random in previous versions and with CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random in newer versions which uses math.random internally. This is not cryptographically strong
An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through for Android. The login credentials are written into a log file on the device. Hence an attacker with access to the logs can read them
An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through for Android through w for Web and through for Desktop. The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial_of_service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer_controlled software in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted
An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through for Android through w for Web and through for Desktop. It uses RSA to exchange a secret for symmetric encryption of messages. However the private RSA key is not only stored on the client but transmitted to the backend too. Moreover the key to decrypt the private key is composed of the first bytes of the SHA_512 hash of the user password. But this hash is stored on the backend too. Therefore everyone with access to the backend database can read the transmitted secret for symmetric encryption hence can read the communication

In res/res_rtp_asterisk.c in Asterisk before before and before and Certified Asterisk before _cert17 and before _cert5 unauthorized data disclosure media takeover in the RTP stack is possible with careful timing by an attacker. The strictrtp option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP stack that learns the source address of media for a session and drops any packets that do not originate from the expected address. This option is enabled by default in Asterisk and above. The nat and rtp_symmetric options for chan_sip and chan_pjsip respectively enable symmetric RTP support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media as the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by default but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT. A change was made to the strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs. When combined with the symmetric RTP support this introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address when expected the new code allowed a new source address to be learned at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was received the strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide media and with symmetric RTP enabled outgoing traffic would be sent to this new address allowing the media to be hijacked. Provided the attacker continued to send traffic they would continue to receive traffic as well

A domain cleanup issue was discovered in the C xenstore daemon aka cxenstored in Xen through When shutting down a VM with a stubdomain a race in cxenstored may cause a double_free. The xenstored daemon may crash resulting in a DoS of any parts of the system relying on it including domain creation / destruction ballooning device changes etc. 
An issue was discovered in Xen through The function `__gnttab_cache_flush` handles GNTTABOP_cache_flush grant table operations. It checks to see if the calling domain is the owner of the page that is to be operated on. If it is not the owner's grant table is checked to see if a grant mapping to the calling domain exists for the page in question. However the function does not check to see if the owning domain actually has a grant table or not. Some special domains such as `DOMID_XEN` `DOMID_IO` and `DOMID_COW` are created without grant tables. Hence if __gnttab_cache_flush operates on a page owned by these special domains it will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer in the domain struct
A grant unmapping issue was discovered in Xen through When removing or replacing a grant mapping the x86 PV specific path needs to make sure page table entries remain in sync with other accounting done. Although the identity of the page frame was validated correctly neither the presence of the mapping nor page writability were taken into account

On Windows installations of the mcollective_puppet_agent plugin version a non_administrator user can create an executable that will be executed with administrator privileges on the next mco puppet run. Puppet Enterprise users are not affected. This is resolved in mcollective_puppet_agent 
Versions of MCollective prior to deserialized YAML from agents without calling safe_load allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet_supplied MCollective plugins but there is a chance that third_party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior
Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to or failed to mark MCollective server private keys as sensitive a feature added in Puppet so key values could be logged and stored in PuppetDB. These releases use the sensitive data type to ensure this won't happen anymore
Versions of Puppet prior to will deserialize data off the wire from the agent to the server in this case with a attacker_specified format. This could be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner which would lead to RCE. This change constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded YAML
The mcollective_sshkey_security plugin before for Puppet uses a server_specified identifier as part of a path where a file is written. A compromised server could use this to write a file to an arbitrary location on the client with the filename appended with the string _pub.pem
Versions of the puppetlabs_apache module prior to and make it very easy to accidentally misconfigure TLS trust.

MACsec feature on Juniper Networks Junos OS X49 prior to X49_D100 on SRX300 series does not report errors when a secure link can not be established. It falls back to an unencrypted link. This can happen when MACsec is configured on ports that are not capable of MACsec or when a secure link can not be established. This can mislead customers into believing that a link is secure. On SRX series devices prior to X49_D100 MACsec was only supported on control and fabric ports of SRX340 and SRX345 devices. SRX300 and and SRX320 did not have any MACsec capable ports. Configuring MACsec on ports that were not MACsec capable would have resulted in this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS X49 prior to X49_D100 on SRX300 series
The Integrated User Firewall UserFW feature was introduced in Junos OS version X47_D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised it may allow access to user credentials workstations servers performing other functions such as email database etc. Inter_Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation check to see if the service is operating from CLI review the following output root@SRX_Firewall# run show services user_identification active_directory_access domain_controller status extensive A result of Status Connected will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device root@SRX_Firewall# run show services user_identification active_directory_access active_directory_authentication_table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain juniperlab.com Total entries Source IP Username groups state administrator Valid engg01 engineers Valid guest01 guests Valid Domain NULL Total entries Source IP Username groups state Invalid Invalid This will also indicate that Valid us

In OpenSSL before d if a malicious server supplies bad parameters for a DHE or ECDHE key exchange then this can result in the client attempting to dereference a NULL pointer leading to a client crash. This could be exploited in a denial_of_service attack
If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32_bit host and a specific cipher is being used then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out_of_bounds read usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305 users should upgrade to d. For Openssl the crash can be triggered when using RC4_MD5 users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to k
There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure in OpenSSL before k and before d. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible although very difficult because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites. Note This issue is very similar to but must be treated as a separate problem
During a renegotiation handshake if the Encrypt_Then_Mac extension is negotiated where it was not in the original handshake or vice_versa then this can cause OpenSSL before e to crash dependent on ciphersuite Both clients and servers are affected
While parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X certificate it is possible to do a one_byte overread. This would result in an incorrect text display of the certificate. This bug has been present since and is present in all versions of OpenSSL since then
In Lenovo Active Protection System before an attacker with local privileges could send commands to the system's embedded controller which could cause a denial_of_service attack on the system or the ability to alter hardware functionality

Installing a zero_permission Android application on certain Samsung Android devices with KK L / and M software can continually crash the system_server process in the Android OS. The zero_permission app will create an active install session for a separate app that it has embedded within it. The active install session of the embedded app is performed using the android.content.pm.PackageInstaller class and its nested classes in the Android API. The active install session will write the embedded APK file to the /data/app directory but the app will not be installed since third_party applications cannot programmatically install apps. Samsung has modified AOSP in order to accelerate the parsing of APKs by introducing the com.android.server.pm.PackagePrefetcher class and its nested classes. These classes will parse the APKs present in the /data/app directory and other directories even if the app is not actually installed. The embedded APK that was written to the /data/app directory via the active install session has a very large but valid AndroidManifest.xml file. Specifically the AndroidManifest.xml file contains a very large string value for the name of a permission_tree that it declares. When system_server tries to parse the APK file of the embedded app from the active install session it will crash due to an uncaught error i.e. java.lang.OutOfMemoryError or an uncaught exception i.e. std bad_alloc because of memory constraints. The Samsung Android device will encounter a soft reboot due to a system_server crash and this action will keep repeating since parsing the APKs in the /data/app directory as performed by the system_server process is part of the normal boot process. The Samsung ID is SVE_2016_6917
A SQL_injection issue was discovered in SageCRM before SP3. The AP_DocumentUI.asp web resource includes Utilityfuncs.js when the file is opened or viewed. This file crafts a SQL statement to identify the database that is to be in use with the current user's session. The database variable can be populated from the URL and when supplied non_expected characters can be manipulated to obtain access to the underlying database. The /CRM/CustomPages/ACCPAC/AP_DocumentUI.asp?SID=<VALID_SID>&database=1' WAITFOR DELAY '0 5'__ URI is a Proof of Concept
An issue was discovered in SageCRM before SP3. The Component Manager functionality provided by SageCRM permits additional components to be added to the application to enhance provided functionality. This functionality allows a zip file to be uploaded containing a valid .ecf component file which will be extracted to the inf directory outside of the webroot. By creating a zip file containing an empty .ecf file to pass file_validation checks any other file provided in zip file will be extracted onto the filesystem. In this case a web shell with the filename '.. WWWRoot CustomPages aspshell.asp' was included within the zip file that when extracted traversed back out of the inf directory and into the SageCRM webroot. This permitted remote interaction with the underlying filesystem with the highest privilege level SYSTEM
An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body.

All versions of Quagga through are vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation in the telnet 'vty' CLI leading to a Denial_of_Service of Quagga daemons or even the entire host. When Quagga daemons are configured with their telnet CLI enabled anyone who can connect to the TCP ports can trigger this vulnerability prior to authentication. Most distributions restrict the Quagga telnet interface to local access only by default. The Quagga telnet interface 'vty' input buffer grows automatically without bound so long as a newline is not entered. This allows an attacker to cause the Quagga daemon to allocate unbounded memory by sending very long strings without a newline. Eventually the daemon is terminated by the system or the system itself runs out of memory. This is fixed in Quagga and Free Range Routing FRR Protocol Suite 2017_01_10

An issue was discovered on NETGEAR R8500 R8300 R7000 R6400 R7300 R7100LG R6300v2 WNDR3400v3 WNR3500Lv2 R6250 R6700 R6900 and R8000 devices. They are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted requests to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely if the remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the router over LAN or WLAN. When trying to access the web panel a user is asked to authenticate if the authentication is canceled and password recovery is not enabled the user is redirected to a page that exposes a password recovery token. If a user supplies the correct token to the page /passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN and password recovery is not enabled they will receive the admin password for the router. If password recovery is set the exploit will fail as it will ask the user for the recovery questions that were previously set when enabling that feature. This is persistent even after disabling the recovery option the exploit will fail because the router will ask for the security questions

A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests in Apache Tomcat .M1 to .M18 to .RC1 to to and to when send file was used results in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request. For example a user agent that sent requests A B and C could see the correct response for request A the response for request C for request B and no response for request C
While investigating bug it was noticed that some calls to application listeners in Apache Tomcat .M1 to .M17 to .RC1 to and to did not use the appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager it was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application
Apache Geode before when a cluster has enabled security by setting the security_manager property allows remote authenticated users with CLUSTER READ but not DATA READ permission to access the data browser page in Pulse and consequently execute an OQL query that exposes data stored in the cluster
In Apache Tomcat .M1 to .M18 and to the handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE before allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads
In Apache Tomcat .M1 to .M18 and to the refactoring of the HTTP connectors introduced a regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing completed quickly it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could result in the same Processor being used for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors and/or response mix_up
During a routine security analysis it was found that one of the ports in Apache Impala incubating to sent data in plaintext even when the cluster was configured to use TLS. The port in question was used by the StatestoreSubscriber class which did not use the appropriate secure Thrift transport when TLS was turned on. It was therefore possible for an adversary with access to the network to eavesdrop on the packets going to and coming from that port and view the data in plaintext

In Apache Batik before files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server _ including confidential or sensitive files _ would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial_of_service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack
The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that occurred the original request and response are forwarded to the error page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file expected behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request regardless of the actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat .M1 to .M20 to .RC1 to and to did not do this. Depending on the original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes the replacement or removal of the custom error page. Notes for other user provided error pages Unless explicitly coded otherwise JSPs ignore the HTTP method. JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request regardless of the actual method. By default the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request regardless of the actual method

Cisco Sourcefire Snort before build mishandles Ether Type Validation. Since valid ether type and IP protocol numbers do not overlap Snort++ stores all protocol decoders in a single array. That makes it possible to craft packets that have IP protocol numbers in the ether type field which will confuse the Snort++ decoder. For example an eth llc snap icmp6 packet will cause a crash because there is no ip6 header with which to calculate the icmp6 checksum. Affected decoders include gre llc trans_bridge ciscometadata linux_sll and token_ring. The fix adds a check in the packet manager to validate the ether type before indexing the decoder array. An out of range ether type will raise 473

SquirrelMail and other versions before 20170427_0200_SVN allows post_authentication RCE via a sendmail.cf file that is mishandled in a popen call. It's possible to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the remote server. The problem is in the Deliver_SendMail.class.php with the initStream function that uses escapeshellcmd to sanitize the sendmail command before executing it. The use of escapeshellcmd is not correct in this case since it doesn't escape whitespaces allowing the injection of arbitrary command parameters. The problem is in _f$envelopefrom within the sendmail command line. Hence if the target server uses sendmail and SquirrelMail is configured to use it as a command_line program it's possible to trick sendmail into using an attacker_provided configuration file that triggers the execution of an arbitrary command. For exploitation the attacker must upload a sendmail.cf file as an email attachment and inject the sendmail.cf filename with the _C option within the Options > Personal Informations > Email Address setting

A Buffer_overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904_GITv _16_g0741801. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable len is assigned strlen buf If the content_>type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT then i the content_>prefix is appended to buf if it actually fits whereupon ii content_>name is written to the buffer. However the check for whether the content_>name actually fits also uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length strlen buf This allows us to write about size many bytes beyond the allocated memory. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2 such as PHP to crash

In Apache Impala incubating before a malicious user with ALTER permissions on an Impala table can access any other Kudu table data by altering the table properties to make it external and then changing the underlying table mapping to point to other Kudu tables. This violates and works around the authorization requirement that creating a Kudu external table via Impala requires an ALL privilege at the server scope. This privilege requirement for CREATE commands is enforced to precisely avoid this scenario where a malicious user can change the underlying Kudu table mapping. The fix is to enforce the same privilege requirement for ALTER commands that would make existing non_external Kudu tables external
