An issue was discovered in Open_Xchange Guard before _rev8. The getprivkeybyid API call is used to download a PGP Private Key for a specific user after providing authentication credentials. Clients provide the id and cid parameter to specify the current user by its user_ and context_ID. The auth parameter contains a hashed password string which gets created by the client by asking the user to enter his or her OX Guard password. This parameter is used as single point of authentication when accessing PGP Private Keys. In case a user has set the same password as another user it is possible to download another user's PGP Private Key by iterating the id and cid parameters. This kind of attack would also be able by brute_forcing login credentials but since the id and cid parameters are sequential they are much easier to predict than a user's login name. At the same time there are some obvious insecure standard passwords that are widely used. A attacker could send the hashed representation of typically weak passwords and randomly fetch Private Key of matching accounts. The attack can be executed by both internal users and guests which use the external mail reader

An issue was discovered in PHP and when the configuration uses apache2handler/mod_php or php_fpm with OpCache enabled. With after or after the issue is resolved in a non_default configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters share a common parent process Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes inherit the SHM descriptor using it to cache and retrieve compiled script bytecode opcode in PHP jargon Cache keys vary depending on configuration but filename is a central key component and compiled opcode can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed. Many common shared_hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to enforce privilege separation among hosted users for example using mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server or php_fpm user settings In these scenarios the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes. PHP scripts often contain sensitive information Think of CMS configurations where reading or running another user's script usually means gaining privileges to the CMS database

iTerm2 before allows remote attackers to discover passwords by reading DNS queries. A new default feature was added to iTerm2 version and unreleased versions such as that resulted in a potential information disclosure. In an attempt to see whether the text under the cursor or selected text was a URL the text would be sent as an unencrypted DNS query. This has the potential to result in passwords and other sensitive information being sent in cleartext without the user being aware
The Good for Enterprise application for Android does not use signature protection for its Authentication Delegation API intent. Also the Good Dynamic application activation process does not attempt to detect malicious activation attempts involving modified names beginning with a com.good.gdgma substring. Consequently an attacker could obtain access to intranet data. This issue is only relevant in cases where the user has already downloaded a malicious Android application
